            Tzuf is a pretty rad dude. In fact, he is so rad that this entire
            page is dedicated to him. Because of this I am going to write things
            about each of these beuitful pictures of him. He is very photogenic, as shown in these images.

            I am not actually sure when this picture came from. I think its
            pretty funny though, and the only other picture I could find of Tzuf
            was one he didn't want on the site so this is what goes here. We
            started to become friends after he forgot his lunch and so as the
            nice kind person I am I sat down with him and just ate my lunch in
            front of him. This was because he didn't want any, but it was a
            funny start to our friendship. Since then we have been pretty good
            friends and he is generally in my classes which is pretty awesome.

            This image is from the time I was following him as he went to the
            bus. I took this picture and sent it to him. I think its a pretty
            funny picture, because it amuses me. As youy can see from this site,
            Tzuf is an awesome human. He is named Tzuf, he's pretty rad, he has
            cool hair, and he is pretty rad. Overall, I think Tzuf is pretty
            rad.

            This is some artwork of Tzuf. It was created by the greatest artist alive, Callumnius Rian. He is known for his many beutiful artworks, but this is his masterwork. As the great art examiner Mr. Rose stated, "I don't even know" in awe of this artwork. He also said "It scares me" in reference to the slightly horrifying air this artwork gives off.
