            Here is my competitive rank in valorant: Iron 1. It is quite hard to
            get to Iron 1 actually, so I am very proud of this acheivment. This
            image also contains my unrated winrate, because my competitive
            winrate sucked. You can see that I win more than half of my unrated
            games, which is pretty cool. You can also see that I am way better
            at starting with defense than attack for some reason.

            Here you can veiw my stats with the pretty cool agent Yoru. He is
            the agent that I am best with, and I have a 2.3 K/D with him, which
            is pretty cool. On average I get 1.3 kills per round with him, which
            for me is very good. It aslo shows that I almost aways use his falsh
            each round, which is probably because I like to use that ability.

            In this image you can see my Kills per game throughout my histroy of
            playing in the past few months. I meant to put my K/D here, but
            messed up and put my kills. However, you can see that I have gotten
            slightly better from when i started. This makes me pretty happy. It
            shows that I get about 10.5 kills per game, which is not good
            because there are aroundd 20 rounds per game, so I get only about
            0.5 kills each round. That is not vey good.

            This is my K/D over time in competititve. I messed up on putting it
            in earleir so I decided to put it in now. You can see that I am
            steadially improving, which I am pretty proud of because this game
            is dificult. My K/D is actually perfectly 1.0 which is funny because
            that means I am now getting one kill for every death which is pretty
            good for me.

            This is my competitivive stats with breach. He is the agent I
            main in competititve. He can blind and stun people, which makes for
            easy kills and is essentially the only way I can get a kill in this
            game. I also have a perfect 50% win rate with him which means I have
            a 50% chance to win when I play with him which is better than
            usual.

            This image also shows how my K/D is exactly 1.0. It also shows that
            I can't hit head shots, hence the 13% head shot rate, which means I
            shoot peoples legs more than their head. That is a little stupid.
