            This is my favorite class. You can see the best teacher ever in this
            picture, and my 100% (as of taking this screenshot). This class is
            what I am making my website for, and I hope it lets me keep that
            100%. That would be pretty cool.

            I go to island school currently. I havce been here since 7th grade.
            It is a pretty good school. I went to Chiefess for 6th grade, and
            Island school is a lot better than Cheifess. I have a lot more
            friends here. One such friend is actually featured on this site on
            the Tzuf page.

            For elementary school, I went to Kalaheo Elementary School. I was a
            very happy little child in elementary school. My vavoirte teacher
            was Mrs. Moises, she was a very strrict teacher but she was also a
            nice teacher. I did not really enjoy 5th grade because it was the
            start of Covid19. Overall I quite enjoyed elementary school.
